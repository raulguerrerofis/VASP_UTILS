# pyvasprun package

## Description
This is an independent project to make the plotting of band structures comming from VASP more easier. The main atractive characteristic of this package you only need very standard python dependences like ``numpy`` and ``pandas`` so is not difficult to install the code like in other cases. I did this proyect to train myself in the coding with Pandas and Data Analyst libraries in Python. Depending on the demand of people who use the library I will create more utilities.

## Instalation

You can install this package by doing

```markdown
    pip install pyvasprun
```

## Usage example

For now, see the ``example.py`` and ``jupyter_example.inpynb``` files.
